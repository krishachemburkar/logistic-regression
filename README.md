# logistic-regression

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using logistic regression. Two approaches are implemented:
1. Using scikit-learn.
2. Writing the logistic regression algorithm from scratch.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/heart-disease-prediction). It contains several medical attributes related to heart disease diagnosis.
